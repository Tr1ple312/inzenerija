<h1>About This Learning Project</h1>

<p>
    This website is a part of an educational project designed to help understand modern web development using Django.
    It showcases the fundamental architecture of a Django application, including Models, Views, and Templates —
    following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
</p>

<p>The project serves as a practical introduction to building web applications, covering user authentication,
    database interactions, and clean URL routing.
</p>

<p>We plan to enhance the project with more features and improvements as we deepen our knowledge of Django and best practices.</p>
