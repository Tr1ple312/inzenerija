<h1>About Our Project</h1>
    <p>
        This website was created as part of a learning project to explore modern web development using Django.
        It demonstrates the basic structure of a Django application, including views, templates, and routing.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to continuously improve the site by adding new features, integrating databases, and following best coding practices.
        Whether you're new to Django or just exploring, we hope this project helps you get started.
